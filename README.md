# Grocart
GroCart is a desktop shopping application that I developed in a team of two, using Java's Swing API in my Objected Programming class (COP4331). 

Getting familiar with UML diagrams, functional specification, documentation, MVC architecture, and various Java design patterns were the main focus of this project.
